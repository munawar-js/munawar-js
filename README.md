I am bringing over a decade of experience as a Frontend engineer with a deep understanding of React.js and end-to-end development of web applications, websites, and design systems. 

My expertise spans from initial concept creation, and design to UI development, all through the final product launch. 

A significant chapter of my career unfolded at Freshworks, where I contributed to amazing products such as Freshdesk, Freshchat, and Freshcaller. 

Currently working on my next idea ðŸ’¡
